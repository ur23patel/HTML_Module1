        <p>Ans:- No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing.HTML tags are used to define the structure and layout of a web page.

            <li>What are tags and attributes in HTML? </li>
        </strong>

            <li>What are void elements in HTML? </li>
        </strong> 
        <p>Ans:- A void element is an element in HTML that doesn't have a closing tag. It is marked up by a start tag only. Void elements are used to represent elements that have no content (a void elements content model  never allows it to have contents under any circumstances), and they cannot have any child elements. Void elements can have attributes. They are self-contained, and they don't require any additional information to be rendered correctly.</p>
        <strong>
              <li>What are HTML Entities?</li>
        </strong>

        <p>Answer:- he List can be used to store the information in short, either in bulleted form or numbered format, that visually help to look at a glance. In other words, it is used to group together related items or lists, & used to structure and show important information where each list item is displayed on the new line.  
            There are 3 types of lists in HTML, namely:</p>
        <ol>
        <li class="inlineList">Unordered List (ul)</li>
        <li class="inlineList">Ordered List (ol)</li>
        <li class="inlineList">Description List (dl)</li>

        <strong>
            <li> What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML 
            elements? </li>
        </strong>

        </strong>
        <p>The &lt;span&gt; HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate.</p>

                &lt; p&gt; My mother has
                &lt; span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold"&gt;

            <li>How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page?</li>
        </strong>
        <p>  In HTML, a background image can be inserted using three methods:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="inlineList">The background attribute in HTML &lt;body&gt; tag,</li>
            <p><strong>Syntax:</strong><br>
                &lt;body background="image_name.image_extension"&gt;  
            </p>
            <li class="inlineList">The background-image property in CSS</li>
            <p><strong>Syntax:</strong><br>
                body {<br>
                    background-image: url("image_name.image_extension");<br> 
                }<br>
             </p>

            <li class="inlineList">Alternatively, we can also use inline styling (CSS within an HTML element using the style attribute) to add a background image.</li>

        <strong>
            <li>How are active links different from normal links?</li>
        </strong>
        <p>The default color for normal and active links is blue. Some browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is placed over that link; others recognize active links when the link has the focus. Those that don’t have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link.</p>
        <strong>
            <li>What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</li>
        </strong>
        <p>We separate a section of texts in HTML using the below tags:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="inlineList">&lt;br&gt; tag It is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line.</li>
            <li class="inlineList">&lt;p&gt; tag–This tag is used to write a paragraph of text.</li>
            <li class="inlineList">&lt;blockquote&gt; tag–This tag is used to define large quoted sections.</li>
